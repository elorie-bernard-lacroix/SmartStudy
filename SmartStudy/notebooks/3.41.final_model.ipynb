This extended study time should also help you to better retain information and to deepen your understanding of complex concepts.\n\nReducing your absences to zero ensures you won't miss any important lectures, discussions, or in-class activities. Regular attendance is key to academic success, as it keeps you engaged with the course material and allows you to interact with your teachers and classmates.\n\nEngaging in sports and music can contribute to your overall wellbeing and cognitive functioning. Both activities can help in stress relief, enhancing focus, and improving memory, which can indirectly enhance your academic performance. Additionally, colleges often look favorably on well-rounded individuals who demonstrate a balance between academics and extracurricular activities.\n\nWhile the recommendation for volunteering remains at zero, this doesn't mean that volunteering is unimportant. It just means that for the purpose of improving your GPA, it's more beneficial to prioritize other activities at this time.\n\nIncreasing parental support level from 1 to 4 can provide you with the emotional and practical support necessary to excel academically. This might involve encouragement, help with structuring study routines, or assistance with overcoming academic challenges. \n\nMaintain your tutoring sessions as they provide an opportunity for personalized learning and immediate feedback. Tutoring can help you to better understand difficult concepts, improve study skills and time management, and increase confidence.\n\nRemember, these changes may seem significant and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Start small, perhaps by increasing your study hours gradually and ensuring regular attendance. Make sure to take breaks and manage your time well to avoid burnout. Don't forget to celebrate small victories along the way. Your persistent efforts and dedication are what will make the difference. You're capable of achieving a 4.0 GPA, and with these changes, you're setting yourself up for success.

This is a commendable goal and I believe that with a dedicated approach and right mindset, you can achieve it. I have reviewed your current habits and proposed changes, and I am confident that these changes will significantly influence your academic performance.\n\nIncreasing your study time from 4.2 hours to 20 hours per week will make a significant difference. This will not only give you ample time to understand the concepts better but also allow for revision and practice. Remember, the key to success in academics is understanding the material and practicing it. The more you practice, the better you'll get. \n\nReducing your absences to zero is another effective step. Regular attendance ensures you do not miss out on any class, discussions, practical lessons, or group studies. It also shows your commitment and seriousness towards your academics. \n\nMaintaining your tutoring sessions will continue to provide you with personalized attention and guidance, aiding in your understanding and application of academic content.\n\nEnhancing parental support from 1 to 4 can create a conducive environment for your studies at home. Parents can hold you accountable, help you manage your time better, and provide emotional support when things get tough.\n\nIncorporating sports and music into your routine is a great idea. These extracurricular activities can help you relieve stress, develop new skills, and provide a balanced life. They also look good on your college applications as they demonstrate a well-rounded student.\n\nRemember, the journey to a 4.0 GPA is a marathon, not a sprint. It will take time, effort, and consistency. But with your determination and these changes, it's absolutely achievable. Believe in yourself and don't get discouraged if things don't go as planned. Every setback is a set up for a comeback. You've got this!\n\nBest of luck on your academic journey.\n\nWarm Regards,\n[Your Name]\nAcademic Advisor</pre>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## gpt generated message (third version) with different prompt"],"metadata":{"id":"dhLB0XCxSSQN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def generate_recommendations_gpt4(current_habits, optimized_habits, desired_grade):\n","    prompt = f\"\"\"\n","    A student wants to improve their GPA to {desired_grade}.\n","\n","    Current habits:\n","    - {current_habits['StudyTimeWeekly']} hours of study per week\n","    - {current_habits['Absences']} absences\n","    - Tutoring: {current_habits['Tutoring']}\n","    - Parental support level: {current_habits['ParentalSupport']}\n","    - Extracurriculars: Sports={current_habits['Sports']}, Music={current_habits['Music']}, Volunteering={current_habits['Volunteering']}\n","\n","    Recommended changes:\n","    - {optimized_habits['StudyTimeWeekly']} hours of study per week\n","    - {optimized_habits['Absences']} absences\n","    - Tutoring: {optimized_habits['Tutoring']}\n","    - Parental support level: {optimized_habits['ParentalSupport']}\n","    - Extracurriculars: Sports={optimized_habits['Sports']}, Music={optimized_habits['Music']}, Volunteering={optimized_habits['Volunteering']}\n","\n","    Please explain how these changes can help improve the student’s academic performance.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    response = openai.chat.completions.create(\n","            model=\"gpt-4\",\n","            messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n","            temperature=0.7,\n","            max_tokens=600\n","        )\n","\n","    response_text = response.choices[0].message.content\n","    display(Markdown(f\"<pre>{response_text}</pre>\"))\n","\n","    return response_text\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AIOwIq3SSTiT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743980230621,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Najma Sultani","userId":"12609476288665903133"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["recommendation_text = generate_recommendations_gpt4(current_habits, optimized_habits, desired_grade)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":228},"id":"lowGHwy7SsZe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743980250138,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":12191,"user":{"displayName":"Najma Sultani","userId":"12609476288665903133"}},"outputId":"b5e70528-f962-4186-98b8-46290a305035"},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"<pre>Increasing hours of study: By studying for 20 hours per week instead of just 4.2, the student will have more time to review material, complete assignments and prepare for exams. This increase in study time can help the student understand the material better, leading to improved academic performance and a higher GPA.\n\nReducing absences: Regular attendance in class is critical for academic success. By reducing the number of absences to zero, the student ensures they don't miss out on any important lectures, discussions, and in-class activities. This can help the student keep up with the course material and perform better in exams.\n\nMaintaining tutoring: Keeping the tutoring sessions can provide the student with extra help in subjects they find difficult. Tutors can offer different perspectives on the material, help clarify doubts, and provide personalized attention that can greatly benefit the student's academic performance.\n\nIncreasing parental support: Parental support can play a significant role in a student's academic success. By increasing the level of parental support, the student may feel more motivated to study and do well. Parents can also help monitor progress, provide resources, and create a conducive environment for study at home.\n\nInvolvement in extracurriculars: Involvement in sports and music can teach the student important skills like time management, teamwork, and discipline. These skills can be transferred to the academic sphere, helping the student manage their study time better and work more effectively.
