            "Increasing study time to 20 hours per week will allow for a more robust understanding of the course material, leading to better exam scores and overall grades. It's important, though, to ensure these study hours are focused, efficient, and well-organized.\n",
            "\n",
            "Absences are increased to 6 which might seem counterintuitive. However, it's important to remember that mental health and wellness are crucial for academic performance. Occasional breaks can prevent burnout and help maintain focus and motivation in the long term.\n",
            "\n",
            "Maintaining extracurricular activity, and adding sports and music, will contribute to a balanced lifestyle. Sports often help with stress management, team skills, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Music can stimulate the brain, relieve stress, and provide a creative outlet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reducing volunteering time will provide more hours for study and relaxation. While volunteering is enriching and adds to personal development, it may be necessary to focus more on academics at this time.\n",

            "\n",
            "Lastly, a tutoring effect score of 20 suggests that seeking additional academic help, like tutoring, can be highly beneficial. Tutors can provide personalized teaching, answer specific questions, and help reinforce concepts learned in class.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's important to remember that improving GPA is a gradual process. Staying motivated throughout can sometimes be challenging. Focus on small, achievable goals and celebrate your progress. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and have some fun. Learning isn't just about grades, but about growing and developing as a person. Keep your end goal in mind and remember why it's important to you. This will help you stay motivated and committed to your plan. Best of luck!\n"
