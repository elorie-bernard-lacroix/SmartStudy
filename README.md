## ideas

### productivity
* project manager / syllabus thing / task manager
* Dream Job Tracker with ML Assistant
* Adaptive Pomodoro Timer (Instead of the standard 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break, the app would use ML to predict how long the user can maintain focus and adjust the work and break intervals accordingly)
* 

### health
* alzeihmers detection (through speech or else)
* sleep cycle detector and alarm
* ingredient checker


### education


### fun


## final proposal
Students often feel overwhelmed with work, deadlines, and extracurriculars. The stress of managing these 
responsibilities can make it difficult for students to establish effective study habits. In this proposal, we discuss the 
development of a machine learning model designed to recommend personalized lifestyle changes, such as the 
optimal weekly study time, the need for tutoring, and increased lecture attendance for students. Overall, this tool 
aims to increase organization and time-management among students and ultimately help them succeed 
academically.

## next steps
* data cleaning & pre-processing (Najma)
* exploratory data anlysis, data visualization (Heraa)
* building the model (Elorie)
* literature reviews (everyone)
