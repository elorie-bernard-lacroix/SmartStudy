## final proposal
Students often feel overwhelmed with work, deadlines, and extracurriculars. The stress of managing these 
responsibilities can make it difficult for students to establish effective study habits. In this proposal, we discuss the 
development of a machine learning model designed to recommend personalized lifestyle changes, such as the 
optimal weekly study time, the need for tutoring, and increased lecture attendance for students. Overall, this tool 
aims to increase organization and time-management among students and ultimately help them succeed 
academically. More details are available here: [2-final-proposal.pdf](https://github.com/elorie-bernard-lacroix/ece324-project/blob/main/process-documentation/2-final-proposal.pdf).
